The idea isnt solid yet but I was going for a racing+platforming type openworld game since it is the most feasible one(given the lack of experience and ppl). But If I'd be bringing people into the project, I am expecting we would definately change category to something we want as a team and have the talent to make it possible.

I am planning rn for a release of around Jan 2023 . Lofty goal, but the time for launch has to be right( plus we got other stuff to do too).

if the game makes profit( yet to decide if game is monetized) , I'll distribute according to contribution .If it doesnt sell ( or the more likely doesnâ€™t finish) you'll be working on ur own interest. Same goes for me.
